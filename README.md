# Music Match

Music Match creates an easy way to make friends for an introverted person or just looking for someone who shares the same unique music taste as you. This idea is one that could make a difference in our lives as we all have very varying music tastes that are shared by little to none of our friends and do not have a popular alternative.

> Features

- Connect users based on similar music interests. Users can select their favourite artists, bands or genre and be matched with other users that share that music taste. Users can also see their matches and can choose to chat.
- Build a centralised music catalogue where users can import their Spotify and YouTube playlists so all of their music from different music streaming platforms can be found in one area.
- Recommend songs to users based on their music listening history so they can find new music that is similar to their music taste.
