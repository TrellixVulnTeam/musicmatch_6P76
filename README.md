# Music Match

### Problem Description

According to a study called, “Exploring Drawbacks In Music Recommender Systems,” interviewees expressed that the music recommended by the recommender systems in music streaming websites does not match with their taste. Sometimes the music recommended was completely different from what they like. A music recommender system, however, is supposed to provide good recommendations for users to solve the information overload problem. However, it has become obvious that the music recommender systems do not meet the demands of the users. There is also no application available for users to import their music from different music streaming platforms into one area so they can organize their music catalogue.

### The Goals of our Project

- To eliminate the drawbacks existing in the Spotify music recommender system by developing our own music recommender system.
- To build a centralized music catalogue where users can import their Spotify and YouTube playlists so all their music from different music streaming platforms can be found in one area.
